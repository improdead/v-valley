# V-Valley Docs

Use this reading order:

### Getting Started
1. `README.md` (repo root): quick start, local run, and first agent.
2. `apps/api/README.md`: endpoint-level API reference and request examples.

### Understanding the System
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: concise internal architecture and data flow.
4. `docs/SYSTEM.md`: deep technical reference — maps, tick pipeline, memory, LLM, API, frontend.
5. `docs/ORIGINAL_GENERATIVE_AGENTS_EXPLAINED.md`: original Stanford GA mapping and parity notes.

### Improvement Roadmaps
6. `docs/AIVILIZATION_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`: agent intelligence upgrades — branching planner, evolving identity, dual memory, tiered recovery. Based on the AIvilization v0 paper.
7. `docs/TOWN_VIEWER_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: frontend enhancements — event feed, agent drawers, day/night cycle, bug fixes.
8. `docs/SCENARIO_MATCHMAKING_PLAN.md`: competitive scenario system — Werewolf, Poker, ELO rating, lobby infrastructure.

If you only need to get running quickly, start with `README.md` and `apps/api/README.md`.
