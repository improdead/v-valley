# Moltbook Reference Snapshot

This directory stores a local snapshot of Moltbook docs for architecture/reference research.

Repository policy:
- This folder is reference-only.
- Do not auto-install Moltbook skills for V-Valley agents.
- Do not treat Moltbook heartbeat flows as required behavior.
- V-Valley onboarding and runtime must work without Moltbook.

When to use these files:
- Comparing external API/skill patterns while designing integrations.
- Writing optional future adapters behind explicit operator opt-in.
